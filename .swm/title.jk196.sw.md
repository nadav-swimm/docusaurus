# **Overview📖**

This was a case study based on Spotify, a popular music streaming service. My main goal was to understand more about the problems that Spotify users are having right now. To better understand consumers’ challenges, I did Desk Research first, then a user survey, and user interviews. After gathering all of the data, I created a Persona.
